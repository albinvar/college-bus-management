# Smart College Bus Management System


The Smart College Bus Management System is an innovative project aimed at enhancing the efficiency and security of student transportation within a college campus. Utilizing Arduino technology and GSM modules, this system enables real-time communication between individual buses and the central college bus server via APIs.

Each bus is equipped with a dedicated machine that interacts with the server to validate students' RFID cards. Through this system, students can conveniently check in and check out of their designated buses using their RFID cards, ensuring accurate tracking of bus ridership and enhancing overall safety and accountability.
